                <h3>The Eiffel Tower</h3>
                <p>The Eiffel Tower is an iconic symbol of Paris. It was constructed between 1887 and 1889 for the Exposition Universelle (World's Fair). Designed by Gustave Eiffel and his team, it was initially met with skepticism, the tower's unique lattice structure soared to a height of 324 meters, becoming the tallest man-made structure of its time. Overcoming challenges during its creation, the tower eventually gained widespread admiration and transformed into an enduring symbol of France's artistic and architectural prowess. <br> <br>Today, it welcomes millions of visitors yearly. Take a look at the map below to navigate there.</p>

                <h4>Athletics</h4>
                <p>Contested in the first ancient Olympic Games, athletics is the oldest sport on record, with the names of champions documented from as far back as 776 BC. The ancient Olympic Games included events such as running races and a pentathlon event that consisted of a running race, long jump, discus throw, javelin throw and wrestling.<br><br> The first meets in modern times that can be likened to the athletics competitions we know today took place in 1840 in Shropshire, England.<br><br></p>

                <h4>Tennis</h4>
                <p>The precursor to tennis was the “jeu de paume”, which originated in France in the 11th century. It was played in a monastery courtyard and involved using the palm of the hand to hit a ball against the walls and sloping roofs. Tennis as we know it today was developed in 19th century England.<br><br> As the sport’s soaring popularity overtook that of croquet, the All England Croquet Club decided to designate its lawns to be used for tennis.<br><br> </p>

                <p>Skateboarding is a young and spectacular sport that developed in the US in the 1950s as surf culture was taking off.<br><br> It was then part of the underground, alternative culture of the 1980s, going hand in hand with the values of freedom, rebellion and thrill seeking. <br><br>The sport continued to develop and became more widely accessible at the start of the 21st century, proving a huge hit among young people.<br><br></p>
